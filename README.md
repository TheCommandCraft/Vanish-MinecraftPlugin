Are you tired of "vanish" plugins that leave traces? Players tab-completing your name? Arrows bouncing off your invisible body? Mobs looking strangely at "empty" air?

**Vanish++** renders other vanish plugins obsolete. Built exclusively for modern **Paper** servers, it utilizes advanced packet interception, native physics manipulation, and deep API hooks to ensure you are **mathematically undetectable**.

It works perfectly out of the box with zero configuration required, but offers granular control for those who need it.

## 🚀 Why Vanish++ is Unrivaled

<details>
<summary><b>🛡️ The "Matrix" Physics Engine (True Intangibility)</b></summary>
<br>

Most plugins just hide you visually. **Vanish++ removes you physically.**

*   **Projectile Pass-Through:** We don't use "teleport hacks." Using native Paper events, arrows, tridents, and snowballs fly **physically through** your body. It is impossible to hit a vanished player.
*   **Zero Collision:** You cannot push players, mobs, or boats, and they cannot push you. You are a ghost.
*   **Mob Ignorance:** Mobs will never target you. You don't exist to their AI. *(Even if you hit them accidentally, they ignore you)*.
*   **No Physical Triggers:** You can walk over Turtle Eggs, Crops, Pressure Plates, Tripwires, and Sculk Sensors without triggering a single vibration or block update.
*   **Raid Prevention:** You won't trigger Bad Omen raids while watching a village.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📶 Deep Protocol Invisibility (Packet-Level Hiding)</b></summary>
<br>

We hook directly into the server protocol to scrub your existence from clients. *(Requires ProtocolLib)*

*   **Nuclear Tab-Completion Scrubbing:** If a normal player tries to Tab-Complete your name in Chat, Vanilla Commands, or Plugin Commands, **you are not there**. Your name is stripped from the packet sent to the client.
*   **Server List Hiding:** The player count in the multiplayer server list is mathematically adjusted. If you are the only one online, the server says "0/20".
*   **Ghost View for Staff:** While normal players see nothing, Staff (with permission) see vanished players in the Tab List as **Gray, Italicized Spectators**, making it easy to coordinate.
*   **Dynmap & EssentialsX Hooks:** Automatically hides you from dynamic web maps and `/who`, `/list`, or `/online` commands.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👁️ Immersion & Compatibility</b></summary>
<br>

*   **Native Language Fake Messages:** When you vanish, the fake "Player left the game" message isn't just text—it uses the **server's native translation packet**. This means a German player sees the message in German, and a US player sees it in English. It is indistinguishable from a real disconnect.
*   **Native TAB Plugin Support:** If you use **TAB (by NEZNAMY)**, Vanish++ hooks directly into it to display your vanish prefix automatically. No manual Placeholder configuration required.
*   **Legacy Plugin Support:** Even without specific hooks, Vanish++ sets standard Bukkit Metadata (`"vanished"`). This means plugins like **CMI**, **TAB**, or custom skripts automatically respect your vanished status.
*   **Silent Chests:** Open Chests, Shulker Boxes, Barrels, and Ender Chests silently. The lid animation **never plays** for others (utilizes temporary spectator switching).
*   **Simple Voice Chat Integration:** Automatically isolates/mutes you in voice chat so you can't be heard or hear proximity chat while stalking.
*   **Smart Item Pickup:** Toggle item pickup with `/vanishpickup`. Don't accidentally steal the diamonds you are watching a player mine.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Granular Control & Safety</b></summary>
<br>

*   **Personal Rules System (`/vrules`):** Decide exactly what you want to do.
    *   *Want to break blocks?* Toggle it.
    *   *Want absolute peace?* Disable "Can Hit Entities".
    *   *Afraid of leaking info?* Enable "Chat Confirmation".
    *   *Need to drop items?* Enable "Can Drop Items".
*   **Heartbeat Synchronization:** Changed a permission in LuckPerms? Promoted someone via Console? The **Heartbeat Task** refreshes visuals instantly. No relogging required.
*   **Dependency Warnings:** The plugin intelligently warns admins if ProtocolLib is missing, but allows you to silence these warnings permanently with `/vignore`.
*   **Accidental Chat Prevention:** If enabled, typing in chat blocks the message and asks you to confirm with `/vchat confirm`. Never leak your presence by accident again.
*   **Async Data Persistence:** All data is saved asynchronously. Server crash? Restart? Your vanish state is saved instantly. No accidental logins.
